|E1 | [Data Repository Finder](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E1_Data-Repository-Finder/blob/main/README.md) |Data Repository Finder helps NICHD researchers find data repositories where they can share data as they develop and implement their NIH Data Management and Sharing Plans. Repositories are added on an ongoing basis. |  <ul><li>[S3: As NICHD staff, I want to be able to update a given field in the Data Repository Finder and track the date and reason for the change, so that I can go back later and review why that decisions was made](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-3.md)</li></ul><ul><li> [S30: As an NICHD researcher, I want to find the best data repositories for the sharing scientific data that I am generating in my project and understand the repository 's submission and sharing practices so  I can complete my Data Management and Sharing Plan](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-30.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S31: As an NICHD program officer, I want to verify that researchers are using data repositories appropriate for the scientific data they plan to share and that their DMS Plan is consistent with the repository's expectations and requirements.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-31.md) </li></ul> |
|E2 | [Record Linkage Implementation Checklist](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E2_Record-Linkage-Implementation-Checklist/blob/main/README.md) |Resource for guiding governance and technical decisions that must be made prior to designing and implementing a strategy for linking data from multiple sources and sharing and using the linked datasets for research. |  <ul><li> [S41: As a researcher/clinician, I want to combine participant-level data collected from multiple studies and data repositories to merge multiple data types for each participant and avoid working with inflated sample sizes to effectively study COVID in children.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-41.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S42: As NIH staff, I want to fund research about the genetic underpinnings of COVID symptoms in children, but I want to avoid paying for duplicate whole genome sequencing for children who have already been sequenced in other studies.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-42.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S43: As an NIH data repository, I want to facilitate longitudinal data analysis of de-identified data from multiple studies to enable data users to study the impact of long COVID in children.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-43.md) </li></ul> |  |
|E3 | [AI Data Readiness Framework](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/AI-Data-Readiness-Framework/blob/main/README.md) |Resource for assessing the AI readiness of data respositories. |  <ul><li> [S62: As a researcher, I want to use DASH BPCA data to train, validate, and test an AI/ML model that predicts adverse events due to antibiotics for intra-abdominal infections in infants with the aim toward recommending the best antibiotic for a patient.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-62.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S63: As a researcher, I want to use transcripts of audio recordings from CHILDES to predict whether or not a child is a late talker.](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-63.md) </li></ul>| |
|E4 | [Data Governance Metadata Schema](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E4_Data-Governance-Metadata-Schema) |A metadata schema for annotating data governance information to inform decisions about data handling across the data lifecycle, including appropriate data linking, sharing, access, and use. |  <ul><li> [S44: As a researcher, I want to access, link, share, and use data from multiple research and administrative data sources (such as CDC NHANES, SAMHSA NSDUH, NIH/NIDA MTF, and ACF AFCARS) so I can study the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and determine whether related outcomes are more severe for children in foster care. ](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-62.md) </li></ul><ul><li> [S45: As a researcher, I want to access, link, share, and use data from multiple research and administrative data sources (such as NIH/NCI NCCR, CMS T-MSIS, and ACF AFCARS) so I can study the impact of COVID-19 infection of COVID-19 infection on pediatric cancer survivors and the impact of COVID-19 infection on future pediatric cancer outcomes. ](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-63.md) </li></ul> <ul><li> [S46: 	As a researcher, I want to access, link, share, and use data from multiple research and administrative data sources (such as NIH/NCATS N3C, PCORnet, NIH RADx, and EPA Air Quality) so I can study whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination results in reduced asthma-related school absences at 3/6/12+ months post-vaccination. ](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/stories/storyID-63.md) </li></ul>| |
